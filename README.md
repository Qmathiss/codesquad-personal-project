Front End
Use HTML to build the structure for the content on all pages. Ensure that your HTML is free of errors and well-organized. Examples of well-organized code include proper indentation, important sections labeled with comments, appropriate use of tags like header and footer, and class names that reflect the type of content they are modifying.
Use CSS to add a "look and feel" to the web app. Connect an external stylesheet to your HTML. Use Flexbox to create sections on each page so that the app layout makes sense and is easy for the user to navigate.
Consider how your app will look on a phone, tablet and desktop/laptop computer. If you are developing the app on your laptop and need a quick way to approximate how your app will look on a phone, for example, you can use your mouse to collapse the browser window to its narrowest width.
Use front-end JavaScript to add interactivity on the page. For example, add a drop-down menu, make the buttons on a page or the rows in a chart change color as the user hovers their mouse over them, or change the color of buttons that are no longer available (make them "grayed out," for example). Display the current time. Have fun with JavaScript to give a great experience for user.
Back End
Use Nodejs and Express to build the infrastructure for your app. Build the web server for the app as a JavaScript file and install & require Node packages to add functionality where needed.
Use EJS to create one or more templates for your app. These templates allow you to send variable data to the user through a single HTML template file.
Use MongoDB to create, retrieve, update and delete your data in a database.
Use Heroku to make your web app live for the entire world to use and see.
